In this section, we will give an overview of the methods and data used for the saccadic flow modelling in Section \ref{sec:biases}.

\subsection{Datasets}

We will uses a number of previously published datasets. The models will be trained on a subset of the 10 datasets used in \cite{clarke-tatler2014}. These data are taken from \cite{clarke2013, tatler2005, tatler2007, yun2013, einhauser2008,judd2009}. The inital saccade after image onset ($9.1\%$ of the data) are excluded, giving us a total of 159,226 saccades. We chose to remove the data from \cite{asher2013} from our training set as the images have an aspect ratio of 5:4, whereas the rest of the data in our training set has an aspect ratio of 4:3. The pedestrian search dataset \citep{ehinger2009} was removed from the training set as previous analysis \citep{clarke-tatler2014} shows that it appears to be biased compared to the other datasets. Both these datasets are now used as test sets to evaluate how well our models generalise. 

We also add a number of other datasets to our test suite collection. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{clarke2009} has a dataset of fixations made during a visual search for a target on a homogeneous textured background (i.e. target in noise). This dataset differs from the previous in that there is no semantic image content in the scene, and the stimuli had a 1:1 aspect ratio. \\

\item \cite{greene-wolfe2012} released a dataset of observers viewing square greyscale photographs.

\item \cite{borji2015} recently released a very large ($\approx 0.625$million fixations, 2000 images) dataset collected over twenty different stimuli types. Given the size of this dataset, and the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, the evaluations on this dataset are presented seperately, and split by stimuli class.\\

\end{itemize}

An overview of the datasets used is given in Appendix Tables \ref{tab:datasets} and \ref{tab:setuptable}.

\subsection{Pre-processing}

As with \cite{clarke-tatler2014} we have normalised all fixations to the image frame, keeping the aspect ratio constant. ie, $(x,y)\in (-1.-1)\times(-a,a)$ with typically $a=0.75$. The initial fixations and saccades were not included in the analysis. Saccades with a start or end point falling outside of the image frame were also removed. 

When fitting saccadic flow models,  we \textit{mirrored} the set of fixations, but adding in reflected copies of the data (reflected in the horizontal, vertical and both midlines). This has two advantages. (i) It is an easy way to make saccadic flow biases in the horizontal or vertical directions. This is similar to how the central bias was defined \cite{clarke-tatler2014}, but by a different mechanism (with the central bias, the model fitting procedure is much simpler and so we just enforced zero mean and 0s in the covariance matrix). (ii) It increases the amount of data available for fitting by a factor of four. This is important as (due to the central bias) there are relatively few saccades that originate from the corners of the images. By equating all corners, we can pool the data and obtain more stable estimates for the underlying distribution. 


The downside of mirroring saccades in this manner is that our model of saccadic flow will be insensitive to the \textit{leftwards} bias in natural scene viewing \citep{nuthmann-matthias}. This will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:LeftRight}. Similary, as ignore the timecourse of saccades we will not capture \textit{corase-to-fine} dynamics. This is discusssed in Section \ref{sec:CoarseToFine}.
